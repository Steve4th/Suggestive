Suggestive
==========

**This is an application to allow the recording and prioritisation of user feedback requests**

This application is inspired by the likes of User Voice. My intention is not to compete with User Voice et al. but to use this type of application to learn to build a better application. I find by trying to build a real world app rather than "hello world" I gain much deeper insight into the technologies used.
**Technology Choices:**
I have decided upon the following technology choices to build this application with. I have chosen these because firstly I want to know more about them and secondly because I don't know them well enough yet.

 - Git and GitHub for source control.
 - Host in Azure Cloud
 - AngularJs to build the browser experience
 - Server-Side framework
